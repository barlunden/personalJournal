### Hello there fellow seekers of the Force!

My name is **Shin’ra Shinobi**, and I’m a Jedi hopeful—part student, part wanderer, and, perhaps, a bit of an influencer in this new era after the fall of the Empire. I grew up on the edge of the Outer Rim, dreaming of ancient temples and
listening to stories about the Jedi who once brought balance to the galaxy.

Now, I’m on my own journey to understand the Force, guided by the wisdom of those who came before me—and by the lessons I learn every day. Through this journal, I’ll share my adventures, my struggles, and the small victories that come with following the Jedi path in a galaxy that’s still healing.

Whether you’re a Force-sensitive, a curious traveler, or just someone searching for hope, I invite you to join me. Together, let’s explore what it truly means to be mindful, to be brave, and to bring a little more light to the stars.

May the Force be with us all!
